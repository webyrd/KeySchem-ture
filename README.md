KeySchem√¶ture: Scheme research implementation of Impro-Visor grammar-related algorithms

This is a not-quite-yet-complete implementation of the CYK-parsing-based "bricks" analyses performed by [Robert Keller's](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/) [Impro-Visor program](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/).  A high-level description of the analyses is contained in:

Robert M. Keller, August Toman-Yih, Alexandra Schofield, and Zachary Merritt.

In Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Computational Creativity, Dublin, 2012.

This code was written during the summer of 2012 by (in alphbetical order): Brittany Moore, Emilie Mitchell, Tevyn Bell, and William Byrd.

Obvious TODOs:

1. Clean up the code.

2. Finish the analyses.

3. Speed things up!

4. Document that code.

5. Evaluate the performance of different analysis techniques.

6. Port code to [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org/).
